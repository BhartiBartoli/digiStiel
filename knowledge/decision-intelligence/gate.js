// CUSTOMER VALIDATION GATE — a PRECONDITION on the Value Plan Proposed→Active transition.
//
// "Understanding precedes Automation." Before a Value Plan may be committed (activated), the
// As-Is understanding must have been validated by the customer. This gate checks a
// validatedAt/validatedBy flag on the SOURCE discovery/memory context that is passed in — it is
// NOT a field on the Value Plan and NOT a new stored object. Missing/empty validation → refused.
//
// GUARANTEE 1 — Validation is a PRECONDITION, not an Approval/Authorization/Decision. It only
// confirms that the As-Is situation was correctly understood. This gate is a factual check on
// "is the As-Is confirmed?", never authorization- or decision-logic.
//
// GUARANTEE 4 — The gate guards COMMITMENT, not interpretation. It may ONLY block the Value Plan
// activation/commitment transition — never knowledge-forming, never evaluation. Observation,
// Advice, Judgement, Trust and Governance Verdict always remain allowed, also without validation
// (see decision-intelligence/*.js — those are pure reads that never touch this gate).
//
// There is exactly ONE managed activation gate here (requestValuePlanActivation); no bypass path.

//   (e.g. from a discovery/memory context) without changing this gate implementation.
// Pure precondition: the source context must carry a non-empty validatedAt AND validatedBy.
